team461/website
===============

This is the semi-final code for the website.
We're going to try to keep everything in this pertinent to the final production; this means that most of the things in this project will be important to the final production (though we will probably not put the actual database things, the actual pages will not be put into this, but the framwork to create the pages automatically and read them from the database when added will be there).
This means no actual content will be added, as we're creating this as a framework.
When _on_ the server, scripts will be used to add content automatically from the old website, but the layout and such will remain.
